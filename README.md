Protein–Ligand Docking Results: GPCR–Glucagon Benchmarking

This repository contains the supplementary log files associated with the study titled:

“Development of Benchmarks for Protein–Ligand Docking”

📄 Description
This repository includes the docking results (log files) for 25 docking experiments involving five GPCR proteins docked with the Glucagon peptide across five popular docking tools. These results were used for graphical and quantitative analysis in the redocking benchmarking study.

Each docking tool was tested against five GPCR–Glucagon pairs to examine whether known binding and non-binding pairs behave as expected in terms of predicted binding affinity and model stability.
